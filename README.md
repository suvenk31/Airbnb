# Airbnb

The project focus on understanding the pricing strategy of Airbnb across 10 major European cities. In this project I have tried gathering some key insights like

✅Average cost of accommodation across major cities
✅Superhost % across cities
✅Price Vs Customer satisfaction index
✅Average price of Studio,1BHK,2 BHK, and 3 BHK+ houses
✅Pricing analysis by individual city

Tools to be used:

1- Power BI
2- Python
3- Microsoft Excel
